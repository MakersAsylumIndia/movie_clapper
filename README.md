fancy movie clapper 

- A movie clapper which is more complex than it needs to be
- Derived from the earlier, simpler (not documented) version we made for "The League of Extraordinary Makers" documentary
- This one has a thumb operated trigger which lifts and drops the clapper arm
- We also added a series of three bright, white LEDs in parallel, running off a CR2032 battery. Wiring for LEDs was via copper tape
- Dropping the clapper arm closed the circuit and activated the LEDs
